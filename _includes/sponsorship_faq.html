      <b>What are the participant numbers for BSidesLV so I know how many swag items to send?</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      We expect about 1,000 this year.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      <b>Are you able to tell me the attendee names, demographics, or company names?</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      We don’t collect this information from our participants. Any “leads” are generated by folks coming to your booth and providing information or business cards directly to you. We respect our participants’ privacy and never collect information during registration. We can say we get a good cross section of researchers, analysts, executives, C-levels, students and infosec enthusiasts.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      <b>Can attendee information be collected at our company’s booth?</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      Yes, if your sponsorship comes with a booth you may ask attendees for their contact information. Sponsors are responsible for supplying their own means of collection. Our badges do not have scannable QR codes. Please be respectful and remember attendees have the right to decline to provide their info.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      <b>What are the table sizes?</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      Gigabit tables are 6' long. Megabit tables are 5' long.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      <b>Are there restrictions for the booth setup?</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      Yes, there are some restrictions for table setup. Floor signs are allowed behind the table or on top of the table, but not in front of it or to the side. Please do not bring signage or other props that extend beyond the length of your table as the space can be very tight! We also ask sponsors to not place items in front of their table to keep the walkways clear. We suggest sponsors do not sit or stand behind the table to maximize attendee interaction.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      <b>Where should items be shipped?</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      Shipping details will be provided closer to the event. You'll be shipping to the venue directly, not to an advanced warehouse.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      <b>How can we have our booth items shipped back?</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      Please note that BSidesNYC does not coordinate outbound shipping needs. Your onsite staff must accommodations to ship any items out. Any items left behind will be considered abandoned.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      <b>When and where does setup and breakdown take place?</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      Sponsors can access the event space 30 minutes earlier than the attendees. Breakdown should occur starting 5pm. We will vacate the venue by 6:30pm.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      <b>What are the times that our booth will need to be staffed?</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      Your table should be staffed during the entirety of the event – 09:00 to 17:00. It may reflect poorly on your organization to have an empty table among other staffed tables.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      <b>Can BSides store my company’s items during the conference itself?</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      No, we do not have the space to store items during the event. There is some space beneath each table, but we recommend your representatives use their hotel rooms for storage (just as we do ourselves).
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      <b>Will we have electrical connection and wireless access?</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      Wireless, yes. There should be power for your table, but it's not guaranteed. We will make a best effort to provide power. We were able to last year.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="text-justify">
      <b>I have a question not answered here, who do I contact?</b>
    </div>
