      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Villages are open spaces divided up by topic that host hands-on activities, demos, and workshops throughout the conference. They are generally less formal than the standard tracks and offer an alternative learning environment from the straight talk/lecture structure. They're also a great place to socialize and make contacts in the community! </p>
      <p>Villages, including recruitment partners, are located on the sixth floor. Come visit!</p>
