    - "This was mostly borrowed from the <a href=\"https://adainitiative.org/continue-our-work/ada-initiative-event-anti-harassment-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Ada Initiative</a> – Thanks for a great policy, we’re happy to apply it to our conference.
<br />
<br />
      BSidesNYC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone at our events. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the organizers or staff.
<br />
<br />
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or other protected class status, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
<br />
<br />
      Exception: Discussion or images related to sex, pornography, discriminatory language, or similar is welcome if it meets all of the following criteria: (a) the organizers have specifically granted permission in writing, (b) it is necessary to the topic of discussion and no alternative exists, (c) it is presented in a respectful manner, especially towards women and LGBTQ people, (d) attendees are warned in advance in the program and respectfully given ample warning and opportunity to leave beforehand. This exception specifically does not allow use of gratuitous sexual images as attention-getting devices or unnecessary examples.
<br />
<br />
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers or staff may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
<br />
<br />
      Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
<br />
<br />
      We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and any related social events."
